# Navigating The Widget

Players can navigate the widget by using either there mouse or using input to move
there badge up, down, left right.
We support two primary actions as well, Interact and Cancel you can think of these as
your A and B buttons on a controller to go forward and back.

Once a Player is registered with the system with there player controller they are able
to send input too the display, this can be done by using the Send Action Input function.
